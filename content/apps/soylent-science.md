**People, not Humans**

A browser extension to rectify some sciences.

## Soylent Science

Soylent Science is a browser extension that will exchange the words 'human' and 'humans' with the word 'people'. Think about what changes when we move from thinking about humans, to thinking about people!

## Even ChatGPT can tell the difference

The terms "humans" and "people" are often used interchangeably to refer to members of the species Homo sapiens, or modern humans. However, there is a subtle difference in the way these terms are used. 

"Humans" is a more general term that refers to all members of the species Homo sapiens, regardless of their individual characteristics or identities. It is often used when discussing the biology or evolution of humans, or when making generalizations about the human experience. 

"People," on the other hand, is a more specific term that refers to individual human beings, often with an emphasis on their personal qualities or characteristics. It is often used when discussing specific groups of humans or when discussing the actions or behavior of individuals.

This simple word replacement can fundamentally change how we perceive and discuss humanity, shifting from a clinical, scientific perspective to a more personal, humanistic one.
