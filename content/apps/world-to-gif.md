**Explore the cringe around you, find the GIFs of the world**

Behind every picture there is a GIF.

## World To Gif

World to GIF is a camera app that allows you to find the GIF that is closer to the picture you've taken. Take a picture, or select one from your camera roll, and a combination of Machine Vision algorithms will detect the style of the picture, which is the dominant object in it, and will search on Giphy for the most appropriate GIF for that picture. 

You can even see what the phone searched for if you tap on the GIF! Because all art is ephemeral, World to GIF does not allow you to keep your pictures or GIFs locally. Turn your world into a GIF and show it to others before it's gone forever!
