**Are your pictures worth taking?**

Let the AI decide!

## Tastegram

Tastegram uses a custom-trained AI to judge your pictures and decide whether they are worthy of saving on your device. Tastegram uses a custom Machine Learning model to evaluate your pictures. Users can choose which AI model will judge their pictures. 

The Art mode is trained on some of the best photographies in history. The Influencer mode is trained on some of the most popular pictures on social media. The extremes mode will only accept what the AI deems as very artistic or very viral pictures. The Standard mode is perfect for those who want a combination of artistic and social-media friendly pictures. 

If your picture passes the AI test, you will be able to save it for posterity. If it does not pass the AI test, the picture you took will disappear forever. Will you dare get your pictures judged by the AI?
