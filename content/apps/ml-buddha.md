**Recreate classic new media art with your smartphone!**

From TV Buddha to ML Buddha - machine learning and the creation of new new media art.

## From TV Buddha to ML Buddha

ML Buddha is a contemporary reimagining of Nam June Paik's iconic 1974 artwork "TV Buddha," which featured a Buddha statue contemplating its own image on a television screen. Our app brings this profound concept into the age of artificial intelligence and mobile technology.

Just as Paik's original work explored the relationship between ancient wisdom and modern technology, ML Buddha uses machine learning to create a meditative experience that bridges the gap between traditional contemplation and contemporary digital art.

## Machine Learning Meets Meditation

Using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms, ML Buddha creates an interactive art experience on your smartphone. The app responds to your presence and movements, generating visual patterns and responses that encourage contemplation and mindfulness.

This isn't just an app â€“ it's a piece of digital art that you carry with you, a pocket-sized meditation tool that connects you to both ancient wisdom traditions and cutting-edge technology. Each interaction is unique, creating a personalized contemplative experience that evolves with your usage.

## New New Media Art

ML Buddha represents the next evolution of new media art, where artificial intelligence becomes not just a tool, but a collaborative partner in the creative process. By democratizing access to sophisticated AI-driven art experiences, we're making it possible for anyone to engage with complex artistic concepts through their mobile device.
