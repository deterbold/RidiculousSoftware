An AI-powered decision-making app that helps you make choices when you can't decide. Simply ask a question and let the app's sophisticated algorithm give you a definitive "Probably Not" or occasionally surprise you with a different answer.

Perfect for those moments when you're overthinking simple decisions. The app uses advanced probability calculations to provide you with the most likely negative outcome, helping you manage expectations and make peace with uncertainty.
