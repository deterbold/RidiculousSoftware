**Everybody can be an artist**

Have you ever felt there was an artist in you, waiting for the right tools?

## With our powerful AI, become the artist you've always been!

Everybody/Art is a revolutionary platform that democratizes artistic creation through the power of artificial intelligence. Our mission is to unlock the creative potential in everyone, regardless of their traditional artistic training or technical skills.

Using cutting-edge AI algorithms, we provide tools that translate your creative vision into stunning visual art. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced artist looking to explore new mediums, our platform adapts to your level and helps you create art that truly represents your unique perspective.

## The Future of Creative Expression

Art has always been a fundamental form of human expression, but traditional barriers like technical skill, expensive materials, and formal training have limited who could participate in the artistic process. Everybody/Art removes these barriers by providing AI-powered tools that understand your creative intent and help bring your ideas to life.

Our first project, ML Buddha, demonstrates how AI can be used to create meaningful, contemplative art that resonates with users on a deep level. This is just the beginning of our journey to make art accessible to everyone.
